## My process

### What I'm proud of

I am proud of having done my first project with TypeScript. It was less familiar than regular JavaScript, but I can see how it will improve my code long-term. I am also happy to have completed the HTML and CSS parts rather quickly, which shows great progress since I have started.

### What I would do differently

I am aware using "eval()" for the calculation isn't the best solution, though it was the most convinient for my level, specially since this isn't a professional project, in the sense I am not doing this officially for any company.

### What challenges I faced

I had some difficulty with the TS code, though I eventually pulled through. The toggle switch only worked once per page refresh, until I tried updating it every time the theme was switched. I also had to look through quite a few Stack Overflow threads to find the solution for the calculation, which I had first assumed would've been easier.

I also had difficulty with the width of the calculator's display. For some reason, it kept leaving the parent's area, and I had to make a poor solution by limiting its size, making it slightly shorter than the rest of the app. I would love to find out the cause of this and how to fix it.
